## Welcome to MoneyPilot (aka MonkeyPilot)

I'm building an open-source educational tool that lets AI agents autonomously manage investment portfolios. Yes, I'm aware this sounds like the setup to a story that ends with my AI collective buying 100,000 shares of a company that makes pet rocks. But there's actually some interesting technology here.

MoneyPilot is in early development - still in the "debating whether config.yaml or config.json shows more professional judgment" phase. Built with Python and FastAPI, it combines prompt engineering, deep research agents, and reinforcement learning to create a platform for studying algorithmic trading and autonomous decision-making. Everything is open-source because transparency matters when you're experimenting with financial automation.

The project started as MoneyPilot (serious, professional), but keeps morphing into MonkeyPilot in my head, which might be more honest. I'm essentially orchestrating multiple AI agents to collaborate on investment decisions - it's like teaching dolphins to play poker: they're incredibly intelligent, but they're operating in an environment they fundamentally don't understand.

The end goal? To democratize financial decision-making and make sound investment strategies accessible to everyone. Because let's face it, the current system where only the wealthy get sophisticated financial advice isn't exactly working out great for the rest of us. If AI can help level that playing field - even a little bit - then this experiment is worth pursuing.

This is purely an EXPERIMENT. If you connect this to real funds, only use money you'd be comfortable setting on fire - I'm talking about cash where you could literally watch it burn and think "well, at least I learned something." The stack includes Claude for analysis, Alpaca's paper trading API, and ongoing negotiations with agents who insist that if 'stonks only go up,' then logically they should leverage everything on margin because it's 'free money.'
